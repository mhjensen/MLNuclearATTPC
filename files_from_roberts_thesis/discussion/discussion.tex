\chapter{Discussion}
The primary aim of this chapter is to frame our findings by the goals for our analysis, as presented in sections \ref{sec:clf_procedure} and \ref{sec:cster_procedure}. We divide the discussion of our results by task. First, we will consider the classification performance of our two implemented algorithms on the three different datasets: simulated, filtered and full AT-TPC data. Second, we discuss the unsupervised clustering performance on the same datasets.
